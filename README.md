# Advent of Code Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code challenges. Advent of Code is an annual coding event featuring daily programming puzzles throughout the month of December.

Advent of Code is an advent calendar of small programming puzzles created by Eric Wastl. These puzzles are released daily throughout December, and participants solve them using any programming language of their choice.

The puzzles vary in difficulty and cover various programming concepts, including algorithms, data structures, mathematics, and more.
